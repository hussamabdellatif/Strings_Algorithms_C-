<br><h1>File Summary</h1>
 
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.cpp : Contains a soluton for the problem: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

<br>************************************************************<br>

is_anagram_O(n).cpp : Contains a soluton in <b>O(n) time complexity </b> for the problem: Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
<br>************************************************************<br>

shortest_completing_word.cpp :
Find the minimum length word from a given dictionary words, which has all the letters from the string licensePlate. Such a word is said to complete the given string licensePlate

Here, for letters we ignore case. For example, "P" on the licensePlate still matches "p" on the word.

It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple answers, return the one that occurs first in the array.

The license plate might have the same letter occurring multiple times. For example, given a licensePlate of "PP", the word "pair" does not complete the licensePlate, but the word "supper" does.

Valid_Parentheses.cpp
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:

Input: "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: "(]"
Output: false
